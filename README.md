# Project Overview

## Kenzie Love is an application designed to connect people through their common interests.

<br>

The development process of this project prioritized creating a **flexible** and **user-friendly** environment, always taking into account their **security**.

<br>

In its basic use the user needs to fill the profile information, being able to add photos, personal interests and **express what they're looking for in their connections**, be it a serious or casual relationship, even simple friendship. In this way the algorithm will return the best match option based on the information passed in the profile.
